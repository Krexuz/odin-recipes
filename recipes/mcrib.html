        <h2 class="subtitle">Boneless Baby Back Rib Sandwich</h2>
        <p>I tip my cap to a certain fast food franchise for coming up with the idea for
            a boneless baby back rib sandwich, the only downside being that they use about
            60 mystery ingredients-- ribs not necessarily being one of them. That's why you
            should try this easy homemade version with real ribs; simply bake, chill, cut,
            sauce, finish on the grill, and voila! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Steps:</h3>
        <div class="steps">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Mix salt, brown sugar, chili powder, pepper, cumin, and cayenne together for
                    the rub.</li>
                <li>Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet. Season both sides generously with
                    some of the rub. Reserve remaining rub for another use. Cover top with parchment
                    paper and wrap foil over the edges. Cover the whole baking sheet with another
                    large sheet of foil, sealing in the sides.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 2 hours and 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Unwrap ribs and let cool briefly until safe to handle. Pull out the bones,
                    stuffing any loose pieces of meat back into the holes and checking carefully for
                    bone fragments. Wrap ribs back up and refrigerate until cold, 8 hours to
                    overnight.</li>
                <li>Cut each rack in half. Brush both sides generously with barbecue sauce.</li>
                <li>Preheat a charcoal grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Grill ribs until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from grill
                    and brush with more barbecue sauce.</li>
                <li>Drizzle more barbecue sauce onto each roll. Sandwich each rib section
                    between a roll and top with coleslaw.</li>
            </ol>
